# haibol2016/fastqfetcher: Output

## Introduction

This document describes the output produced by the pipeline. The main outputs are compressed FASTQ files downloaded from SRA, along with quality control reports from FastQC and MultiQC.

The directories listed below will be created in the results directory after the pipeline has finished. All paths are relative to the top-level results directory.

## Pipeline overview

The pipeline is built using [Nextflow](https://www.nextflow.io/) and processes data using the following steps:

- [FASTQ files](#fastq-files) - Compressed FASTQ files converted from SRA data
- [FastQC](#fastqc) - Raw read QC
- [MultiQC](#multiqc) - Aggregate report describing results and QC from the whole pipeline
- [Pipeline information](#pipeline-information) - Report metrics generated during the workflow execution

### FASTQ files

<details markdown="1">
<summary>Output files</summary>

- `fastq/`
  - `*.fastq.gz`: Compressed FASTQ files converted from SRA data
    - For single-end reads: One file per SRA accession (e.g., `SRR123456.fastq.gz`)
    - For paired-end reads: Two files per SRA accession (e.g., `SRR123456_1.fastq.gz`, `SRR123456_2.fastq.gz`)
    - For single-cell RNA-seq: Multiple files per SRA accession (typically 2-4 files)

</details>

The primary output of the pipeline is compressed FASTQ files (`.fastq.gz`) converted from SRA data. These files are:

- **Downloaded** from NCBI SRA using `prefetch` (SRA Toolkit)
- **Converted** from SRA format to FASTQ format using `fasterq-dump` (SRA Toolkit)
- **Compressed** using `pigz` (parallel gzip) for efficient storage
- **Organized** by SRA accession ID in the filename

The FASTQ files are ready for downstream analysis workflows such as alignment, assembly, or other NGS analysis pipelines. File naming follows the pattern: `{SRA_ACCESSION}_{READ_NUMBER}.fastq.gz` where `{READ_NUMBER}` is omitted for single-end reads, or `_1`/`_2` for paired-end reads.

### FastQC

<details markdown="1">
<summary>Output files</summary>

- `fastqc/`
  - `*_fastqc.html`: FastQC report containing quality metrics.
  - `*_fastqc.zip`: Zip archive containing the FastQC report, tab-delimited data file and plot images.

</details>

[FastQC](http://www.bioinformatics.babraham.ac.uk/projects/fastqc/) gives general quality metrics about your sequenced reads. It provides information about the quality score distribution across your reads, per base sequence content (%A/T/G/C), adapter contamination and overrepresented sequences. For further reading and documentation see the [FastQC help pages](http://www.bioinformatics.babraham.ac.uk/projects/fastqc/Help/).

### MultiQC

<details markdown="1">
<summary>Output files</summary>

- `multiqc/`
  - `multiqc_report.html`: a standalone HTML file that can be viewed in your web browser.
  - `multiqc_data/`: directory containing parsed statistics from the different tools used in the pipeline.
  - `multiqc_plots/`: directory containing static images from the report in various formats.

</details>

[MultiQC](http://multiqc.info) is a visualization tool that generates a single HTML report summarising all samples in your project. Most of the pipeline QC results are visualised in the report and further statistics are available in the report data directory.

Results generated by MultiQC collate pipeline QC from supported tools e.g. FastQC. The pipeline has special steps which also allow the software versions to be reported in the MultiQC output for future traceability. For more information about how to use MultiQC reports, see <http://multiqc.info>.

### Pipeline information

<details markdown="1">
<summary>Output files</summary>

- `pipeline_info/`
  - Reports generated by Nextflow: `execution_report.html`, `execution_timeline.html`, `execution_trace.txt` and `pipeline_dag.dot`/`pipeline_dag.svg`.
  - Reports generated by the pipeline: `pipeline_report.html`, `pipeline_report.txt` and `nf_core_fastqfetcher_software_mqc_versions.yml`. The `pipeline_report*` files will only be present if the `--email` / `--email_on_fail` parameters are used when running the pipeline.
  - Parameters used by the pipeline run: `params.json`.

</details>

[Nextflow](https://www.nextflow.io/docs/latest/tracing.html) provides excellent functionality for generating various reports relevant to the running and execution of the pipeline. This will allow you to troubleshoot errors with the running of the pipeline, and also provide you with other information such as launch commands, run times and resource usage.
